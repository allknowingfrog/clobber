# Clobber

Clobber is an attempt to clone an obscure Windows game called Slay.

This began as a purely JavaScript endeavor. The "legacy" branch contains this inital effort, a relatively playable, local hotseat version. This is the version hosted at https://allknowingfrog.github.io/clobber.

More recently, I began working on a node-based version for a better multiplayer experience. It currently contains all of the features of the original, plus slightly better graphics. After launching the server file (app.js) with node, players can connect on port 3000 via their browser.
